# AI Module

This module is the core of MusicElvis's music generation capabilities, implementing AI-powered music creation with Elvis-style characteristics.

## Structure

- `models/`: Neural network models for music generation
- `preprocessing/`: Data preprocessing and feature extraction
- `tests/`: Unit tests and integration tests

## Technology Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow/PyTorch
- Transformers (RoBERTa/T5)
- MusicGen
- VALL-E

## Features

- Natural Language Song Processing (NLSP)
- Music synthesis engine (GANs/VAEs)
- Audio post-processing (DSP)
- Elvis-style transfer and adaptation

## Components

### NLSP Parser
- Converts natural language prompts into musical parameters
- Understands musical intent and style preferences

### Music Generation
- Creates melodies and harmonies in Elvis style
- Handles arrangement and instrumentation

### Audio Processing
- Applies Elvis-style characteristics
- Manages audio quality and effects

## Development

Detailed setup instructions and contribution guidelines coming soon.
